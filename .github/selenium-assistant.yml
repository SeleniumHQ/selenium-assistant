  👋 Hi there! Thank you for creating this issue.


  I am the Selenium Assistant Bot 🤖, I triage issues in this repository.
  If I can't do it, I label it to help maintainers identify issues that need triaging.


  I am an Open Source project 🙌, post bugs or ideas [here](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-assistant)!

# Is the assistant actively closing any new open issues requesting support or asking questions?
closeQuestionsAndSupportRequests: true

# Strings used by the bot to identify that the issue is a request for support or a question?
# If left empty or `false` the bot won't close any support requests or questions
questionsAndSupportRequestsStrings:
  - 💬
  - questions and help

# Comment users get when a support request or question is created as an issue.
closeQuestionsAndSupportRequestsComment: >
  💬 It looks like this is a request for support or a question


  💡 A better way to address this is:


  * 📫 Send questions and support requests to the [Selenium user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-users)

  * 📮 Post them to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium)

  * 🗣 Join us in the [IRC/Slack channel](https://seleniumhq.herokuapp.com/) where the community can help you as well

  ❗️ It seems this issue is not using any of the supported templates


  💡 Supported issue types are (they start with):


  * 🐛 Bug Report (bugs found in a recent release)

  * 🚀 Feature Proposal (a useful feature you would like to propose)


  Issue templates help this project to stay in shape, please use them and fill them out completely.
  By doing that you are helping the project because the community and maintainers can provide prompt feedback,
